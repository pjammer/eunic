Eunic - A Bash script to Manage Unicorn

Setup and Install:
=======
You git cloned it, right? Do it now.

1. In the source directory where you downloaded this repo:

    cp eunic /usr/local/bin
    chmod +x /usr/local/bin/eunic

2. To install eunic:

   eunic -I /path/to/your/app

3. OPTIONAL: Change Default Environment. Set to `production` right now.
   eunic -D development

Command Usage (with Default Environment, production to start):
==============

Restart:
    eunic -r

Start:
    eunic -s

Stop:
    eunic -x

Command Usage (with another Environment):
==============

Restart:
    eunic -R development

Start:
    eunic -S development

USR Usage (add Environment):
==============

Reload:
    eunic -b production

-b is really untested in this script. There is the USR reload thing in here but f'd if I can get USR to work consitently. I should try again.

TODO:
=====
Figure out USR.  Dig up the blog post on how to use that.

http://blog.kiskolabs.com/post/722322392/unicorn-init-scripts was the first iteration of this script. I started this way, moved to functions later in the first commit.
